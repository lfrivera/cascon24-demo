### Credor Eichi II

#### GBLT996

##### Description

Ever since Credor was born in 1974, each of its creations has showcased the beauty of Japanese aesthetics combined with excellence in watchmaking. Based on the French crete d’or, or “crest of gold,” the Credor name has always suggested the highest echelon of artistry in watchmaking. The year 2024 marks Credor's 50th anniversary, and a special edition of the acclaimed Eichi II will mark the occasion.

The commemorative watch features a deep blue porcelain dial whose color is referred to as ruri, after the Japanese word for lapis lazuli. The dial has a gentle curve thanks to the careful application of porcelain glaze, which creates surface tension and gives it a slightly domed shape. The porcelain glaze also creates an effect that enables wearers to enjoy the dial’s varying colors depending on the angle of view and the brightness of the surroundings. The hour markers, the Credor logo at the twelve o'clock position, and the Credor letters are all hand-painted by a craftsman at the Micro Artist Studio, the elite watchmaking workshop where the watch is crafted. After the dials are fired, gold is applied over the paint to create a warm, multi-dimensional beauty that only hand-craftsmanship of the highest order can achieve. The technique is a nod to ‘Ruri-Kinsai,’ a famous yet rare form of traditional craftwork that came to widespread attention during the Edo period, in which gold is overglazed on ruri-colored material, such as porcelain. The arduous and highly technical application of gold on the ruri-colored dial combined with the 18K yellow-gold case creates a unique beauty befitting a watch made to celebrate Credor’s 50th anniversary.

When the mainspring has been fully wound and the torque output is at its highest, approximately 30% of the available power is not needed to maintain the precision of the watch and is in effect wasted in a normal movement. The Torque Return System uses this energy to rewind the mainspring, increasing the power reserve. In Caliber 7R14, this system is active for 35 hours after the mainspring has been fully wound.
By using the available energy more effectively, the Torque Return System increases the power reserve of the Caliber 7R14 to around 60 hours. This represents a 25% improvement over the manual-winding Spring Drive Caliber 7R88, which delivers 48 hours of power reserve.

The edges of the movement’s bridges and the holes for the screws and jewels are convex and polished by hand by skilled artisans to catch light from any angle.

#### GBLT997

##### Description

Eichi II The ‘Ruri’ dial. Known as Ruri in Japan and elsewhere as lapis lazuli, this deep blue color has entranced makers of jewelry and other objets d’art for centuries because of its intensity and its richness.
This Ruri blue perfectly suits the simple, clean layout of the Eichi Ⅱ dial and provides the ideal contrast to the white indexes and hands. The Eichi II was created by the artisan team of high-end watchmakers at the Micro Artist Studio*.The high-temperature fired surface enamel glaze generates surface tension in the molten crystal, producing a natural curvature that gives the proclein dial a wonderfully handmade feel. The Micro Artist Studio team tried more than 20 different combinations of glaze blends and repeated firings before arriving at the required sense of azure depth from the thin enamel glaze. The blue hue varies in accordance with light intensity in an endlessly fascinating color display. The unadorned hour marks and Credor logo are all hand-drawn and have their own distinctive depth and visibility.

When the mainspring has been fully wound and the torque output is at its highest, approximately 30% of the available power is not needed to maintain the precision of the watch and is in effect wasted in a normal movement. The Torque Return System uses this energy to rewind the mainspring, increasing the power reserve. In Caliber 7R14, this system is active for 35 hours after the mainspring has been fully wound. By using the available energy more effectively, the Torque Return System increases the power reserve of the Caliber 7R14 to around 60 hours. This represents a 25% improvement over the manual-winding Spring Drive Caliber 7R88, which delivers 48 hours of power reserve.

Visible through the see-through back are the movement bridge, rubies and delicately chamfered screw holes, all hand-polished with smooth curves and a mirror finish that shines brilliantly from any angle.

### Golden Ellipse

#### 5738/1R

##### Description

An elliptical case, between a circle and a rectangle. A dial in blue gold, with gold hands and hour markers floating over its depths. When it first appeared in 1968, Patek Philippe’s Golden Ellipse was a bold departure from traditional watch shapes. But far from bowing to fashion, this innovative watch had a sense of inner harmony that was very pleasing to the eye. Its design was inspired by the principle of the “golden section” discovered by the ancient greek mathematicians. This “divine” proportion, expressed as a ratio of 1 / 1.6181, forms the basis of some of history’s greatest works of art and architecture.

The large-sized Golden Ellipse Reference 5738 welcomes its first metal bracelet. Composed of links set in fine rows reminiscent of chain bracelets, this supple, elegant chain-style bracelet in rose gold – with an engraved clasp pays a fine tribute to the 1970s, during which the Golden Ellipse watch played a starring role.

The sunburst ebony black dial is enhanced by applied baton-type hour-markers and slim cheveu-type hands in rose gold. This timeless, uncluttered aesthetic perfectly sums up the spirit of the Golden Ellipse.

The harmoniously proportioned case inspired by the famous Golden Ratio houses ultra-thin self-winding 240 caliber.

### Day-Date

#### Oyster, 40 mm, Everose gold Reference 228235

##### Description

The Oyster Perpetual Day-Date 40 in 18 ct Everose gold with a slate ombré dial, fluted bezel and a President bracelet.

The Rolex fluted bezel is a mark of distinction. Originally, the fluting of the Oyster bezel had a functional purpose: it served to screw the bezel onto the case helping to ensure the waterproofness of the watch.

It was therefore identical to the fluting on the case back, which was also screwed onto the case for waterproofness, using specific Rolex tools. Over time, the fluting became an aesthetic element, a genuine Rolex signature feature. Today the fluted bezel is a mark of distinction, in gold on this Day-Date 40.
